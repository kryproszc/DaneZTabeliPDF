
Thank you for contacting us on this matter. We are very sorry that your registration form somehow didn’t reach us.
As Marie mentioned, I can now add you to the participants list.

Do I understand correctly that you will attend the training both days (7th and 8th October)?
Do you have any food requirements – vegan, gluten/lactose free, etc.?
Would you like also to attend a dinner at own expense on 7th at around 18:00?

Once I have your replies, I will add you to the participants list.
